#SINTH

Presenting SINTH, a new way of synthesis. Are you tired of boring pianos and keyboards? are you bored of tiring pads or clavs? 

This is the ticket out my friend. This monster is equipped with 7 carbon fibre steel sliders, each with built-in presets of effects that can be adjusted (within reason) to your every whim. I will detail the operational functions of each preset below.

1. The Pitch Re-Triangualizationizer. A complex ai that allows you to adjust the pitch of the instrument to your liking in real time! The ai uses cutting edge tech like satelites to modulate sounds!

2. Bit Depthoressional Compactionizer. A marvel of software that allows the user to adjust crush all the bits in their sounds (function not included here). Here you can adjust how much of the effect comes through with a slider alone, isnt that crazy?!

3. Stereorectrical Dynamicisation Sweeper. This is the future of stereo imaging. This allows one to play their sounds through both speakers by moving the sound between them giving the effect of a moving sound. Every aspect of this software (created by Tomas Calderon) is perfectly flexible to whatever you may use it for (not included in this demo).

4. Distortipressionalgater. The hallmark of sound modulation. invented in 1999, it still sees use today (full version not accesible here). In this demo you may adjust how much of the effect adjusts the instrument's abrasive side, now that sounds cool.

5. Tremolo

6. Automated Wahtcuky Fried Wauto. The more creative of developers created a stunning modulation effect to apply to our instrument here (in wetness value only). Truly has never been replicated in quality of sound, we are proud to present it here in full (demo version only).

7. Reverb

The adjustable percentage value your rating of how awesome your experience is, it can't go lower than 25% since I know you'll like it.

I hope you enjoy this feat of my efforts. It's been my life long project, been going for 7 years now. I've truly never been more proud of anything. Nothing gives more joy than this. I sincerly hope you enjoy taking a step... into the future.
